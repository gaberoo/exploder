NAME
     subplex - subspace-searching simplex method for unconstrained
     optimization

DESCRIPTION
     Subplex is a subspace-searching simplex method for the
     unconstrained optimization of general multivariate functions.
     Like the Nelder-Mead simplex method it generalizes, the subplex
     method is well suited for optimizing noisy objective functions.
     The number of function evaluations required for convergence
     typically increases only linearly with the problem size, so for
     most applications the subplex method is much more efficient than
     the simplex method.

INSTALLATION
     To build subplex on UNIX systems, edit the Makefile as necessary
     and type:

	     make

     This will create a linkable library named subplex.a and a
     demonstration executable named demo.

EXAMPLE
     To run subplex on a simple objective function type:

	     demo < demo.in

     To run subplex on other problems, edit a copy of the sample driver
     demo.f as necessary.
